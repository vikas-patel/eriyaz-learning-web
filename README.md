Karma quick start :-
Included karma dependencies in package.json, so just run "npm install" to install karma.
Next install karma-client with "npm install -g karma-cli"
karma.conf.js was created using "karma init karma.conf.js"
Start karma with "karma start"
run tests with "karma run"
to add more tests add them in test directory & include them in karma.conf.js.
